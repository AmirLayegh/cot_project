If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?\n\nA: Let's start by using the information given in the question:\n\n* There were 100 guests at the wedding reception.\n* Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.\n* The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door.\n\nWe know that the total number of cookies given to the church next door is half of the total number of cookies brought by the guests, which is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.\n\nSo, if each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, the number of people in the church next door is:\n\n1500 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 100 people\n\nTherefore, there were 100 people in the church next door."}

If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how much change does he have after he buys the hay?\n\nA: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Michael's horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, so it covers a distance of:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = 32MPH x 0.5 = 16 miles\n\n2. Since Michael eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile his horse runs, he will need:\n\nHay needed = Distance / 2 = 16 miles / 2 = 8 bails of hay\n\n3. Each bail of hay costs $3, so Michael will need to spend:\n\nCost = Number of bails x Price per bail = 8 bails x $3 = $24\n\n4. Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has a total of:\n\nTotal money = Number of bills x Value per bill = 6 bills x $5 = $30\n\n5. After buying the hay, Michael will have:\n\nChange = Total money - Cost = $30 - $24 = $6\n\nTherefore, Michael has $6 in change after buying the hay."}
