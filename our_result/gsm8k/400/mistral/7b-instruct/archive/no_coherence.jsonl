[{"question": "Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests in the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?", "llm_answer": "First, let's find out how many cookies were brought by all the guests. Each guest brought 15 cookies, so there were 100 guests, so there were 100 * 15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.\n\nThen, the bride gave half of the cookies to the church next door. So, 1500 cookies were reduced by half, leaving 1500 / 2 = <<1500/2=750>>750 cookies for the wedding reception.\n\nEach person in the church next door got 15 cookies, so the number of people in the church next door is 750 / 15 = <<750/15=50>>50. Answer: 50.", "gt_answer": "If each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, then the total number of cookies brought is 100*15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.\nIf the next church was given 1/2 the number of cookies, then they got 1/2*1500 = <<1/2*1500=750>>750 cookies.\nIf each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then there were 750/15 = <<750/15=50>>50 people.\n#### 50", "time": 17.278028964996338}]
