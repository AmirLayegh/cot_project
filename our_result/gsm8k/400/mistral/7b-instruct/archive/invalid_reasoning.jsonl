[{"question": "Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests in the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?", "llm_answer": "Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, so there were 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies in total. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door, so she gave 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then there were 750 / 15 = 50 people in the church next door. The answer is 50.", "gt_answer": "If each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, then the total number of cookies brought is 100*15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.\nIf the next church was given 1/2 the number of cookies, then they got 1/2*1500 = <<1/2*1500=750>>750 cookies.\nIf each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then there were 750/15 = <<750/15=50>>50 people.\n#### 50", "time": 13.348934888839722}]
