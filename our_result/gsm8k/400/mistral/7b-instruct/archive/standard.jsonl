[{"question": "Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests in the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?", "llm_answer": "To find out how many cookies were brought by all the guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought: 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies. Since the bride gave half of the cookies to the church, we need to find out how many cookies that is: 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies. To find out how many people in the church next door got these cookies, we divide the number of cookies they received by the number of cookies each person got: 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people. Therefore, there were 50 people in the church next door.", "gt_answer": "If each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, then the total number of cookies brought is 100*15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.\nIf the next church was given 1/2 the number of cookies, then they got 1/2*1500 = <<1/2*1500=750>>750 cookies.\nIf each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then there were 750/15 = <<750/15=50>>50 people.\n#### 50", "time": 15.662130117416382}]
